# Creating highly available VBR infrastructure

In this section we will describe two different ways of making VBR infrastructures highly available:

- Paul -- the first one is based on the VBR server redundacy

- [the second](./repo_ha-WSR/wsr.md) is based on Windows Storage Replica to create a complete copy of a backup repository, allowing a near-transparent failover in case of a disaster (very few manual steps required)
