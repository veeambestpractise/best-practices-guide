# Universal Storage Integration API

Veeam Backup & Replication offers built-in integrations with storage systems to help decrease impact on the production environment and significantly improve RPOs. Storage vendors, in turn, can leverage Veeam Universal Storage API framework to integrate their storage solutions with Veeam Backup & Replication. With this kind of integration Veeam Backup & Replication uses snapshots of Universal Storage API integrated systems to perform backup and restore operations.

The following storage systems are supported:
